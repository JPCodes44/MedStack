# MedStack

A comprehensive roadmap to develop the **Must Have** and **Nice to Have** skills for embedded software roles in a regulated environment (like medical devices). This roadmap is inspired by Medtronic’s stated qualifications and focuses on C/C++ development, embedded systems, real-time software, driver development, and more.

## Overview
This repository contains a step-by-step plan to **build expertise** in the following areas:
- Embedded C and C++ software development
- Real-time operating systems (RTOS)
- Driver development and integration
- Embedded graphics libraries
- Communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI, USB)
- Software development in a regulated environment (medical, defense, aviation)
- Configuration management and version control

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Core Programming & Tooling
- **Goals**: 
  - Strengthen C/C++ fundamentals (pointers, memory management, OOP, STL).
  - Learn Git basics, branching, merging, and CI/CD fundamentals.
  - Start small embedded projects (e.g., blinking an LED, reading a sensor) to get used to toolchains and debuggers.

### Phase 2: Foundations in Embedded Systems
- **Goals**:
  - Dive into microcontroller architecture, interrupts, and memory-mapped I/O.
  - Learn or experiment with a basic RTOS like FreeRTOS.
  - Practice cross-compiling and debugging on a Linux environment (e.g., Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black).

### Phase 3: Specialized Embedded Topics
- **Goals**:
  - Implement or modify drivers for specific peripherals (GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, USB).
  - Experiment with embedded graphics (LVGL, Qt) to display data on small LCDs.
  - Explore real-time constraints and scheduling (if relevant to your system).

### Phase 4: Advanced & Regulated Environment Skills
- **Goals**:
  - Learn about medical/regulated industry standards (ISO 13485, FDA guidance).
  - Work on thorough documentation: requirements, design, risk analysis, testing.
  - Consider advanced debugging techniques, system-level profiling, and safety-critical design patterns.

### Phase 5: Integrated Capstone Project
- **Goals**:
  - **Build a single project** that brings together all the above:
    - Collect sensor data (temperature, pressure, etc.).
    - Use an RTOS or a Linux-based system to schedule tasks.
    - Display real-time data on a small LCD with an embedded UI library.
    - Provide a command interface over serial/USB (or both).
    - Document everything as if for a regulated device, including design artifacts and test protocols.

## How to Use This Roadmap
1. **Pick a Board**: Decide on a microcontroller or SBC (e.g., STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi).
2. **Plan Your Timeline**: Dedicate time for each phase; don’t rush—focus on *understanding* and *practical demos*.
3. **Build Small Projects**: Each phase should have at least one hands-on project.
4. **Document & Reflect**: Keep logs of challenges, solutions, and next steps. This helps with regulated environment practice.
5. **Showcase**: Use GitHub (or similar) to host your code, diagrams, and markdown docs. This can serve as a portfolio for job interviews or team demos.

> **Note**: This roadmap is meant as a **guidance tool**. Adjust timelines and depth based on your specific needs and prior experience. Regularly revisit and refine the roadmap as you discover new challenges or interests in the embedded domain.
