## 🔎 Overview
This repository contains a step-by-step plan to **build expertise** in the following areas:

- **Embedded C and C++ Software**  
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) & Linux**  
- **Driver Development** (GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, USB)  
- **Embedded Graphics** (LVGL, GTK3, Qt)  
- **Regulated Environment Principles** (ISO/FDA compliance)  
- **Configuration Management & Version Control** (Git)  

The roadmap helps you **sequentially** develop the skills you need for an embedded role at Medtronic (or any similarly regulated industry).

## 🗺️ Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Core Programming & Tooling
**Goals**  
- Strengthen fundamental C/C++ (pointers, memory management, OOP).  
- Learn Git branching strategies, merge conflicts, and basic CI setups.  
- Start small embedded projects (like blinking an LED or reading a sensor) to become comfortable with cross-compilers and debuggers.

**Key Tasks**  
- Implement simple data structures in C.  
- Practice Git by creating feature branches & resolving merge conflicts.  
- Document everything in a concise README or wiki page.

### Phase 2: Foundations in Embedded Systems
**Goals**  
- Dive into microcontroller architecture (memory-mapped I/O, interrupts).  
- Explore a basic RTOS (FreeRTOS) or embedded Linux environment (Raspberry Pi/BeagleBone).  
- Practice configuring timers, handling interrupts, and writing ISR (Interrupt Service Routines).

**Key Tasks**  
- Write a FreeRTOS task that reads sensor data at intervals.  
- Cross-compile a Hello World program for a Linux SBC.  
- Debug hardware-level issues (baud rate mismatches, etc.).

### Phase 3: Specialized Embedded Topics
**Goals**  
- Learn or modify drivers for peripherals (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C).  
- Experiment with embedded graphics (LVGL or Qt on a small display).  
- Incorporate real-time constraints into your application (scheduling, priority).

**Key Tasks**  
- Implement a custom driver for a chosen sensor (e.g., temperature, humidity).  
- Create a simple user interface on an LCD or OLED.  
- Ensure the application meets real-time requirements (e.g., consistent sensor sampling).

### Phase 4: Advanced & Regulated Environment Skills
**Goals**  
- Familiarize yourself with regulatory standards (ISO, FDA, DO-178C).  
- Learn about thorough documentation: design specs, risk analyses, traceability.  
- Implement advanced debugging (JTAG/SWD), system profiling, or memory leak detection.

**Key Tasks**  
- Write a mini **Design History File** for your embedded project.  
- Identify and document potential risks (power failures, sensor errors).  
- Run static analysis tools (Cppcheck, clang-tidy) to ensure code quality.

### Phase 5: Integrated Capstone Project
**Goals**  
- **Combine all learned skills** in a single project:
  1. Read multiple sensors via I2C/SPI.  
  2. Render real-time data on a small screen (LVGL or Qt).  
  3. Provide USB or serial CLI for user commands.  
  4. Run under an RTOS or on a Linux SBC with service/daemon.  
  5. Document everything in a regulated-style format.

**Key Tasks**  
- Design your project architecture (tasks, data flow, drivers).  
- Implement data logging (SD card or remote server).  
- Present your design with full documentation and testing procedures.

## 🚀 How to Use This Roadmap
1. **Select Your Hardware**  
   - Choose a microcontroller dev board (STM32, ESP32) or SBC (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone).  

2. **Phase-Based Learning**  
   - Tackle each phase in sequence, focusing on both theory and practical hands-on projects.  

3. **Document as You Go**  
   - Keep logs, diaries, or wikis for each milestone. This simulates regulated documentation.  

4. **Showcase & Reflect**  
   - Push your code, diagrams, and documentation to GitHub.  
   - Summarize your key learnings after each phase.

5. **Iterate & Expand**  
   - Revisit earlier phases to add complexity or refine your approach.  
   - Continuously share, get feedback, and update your documentation.
